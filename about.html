<h1>About Me</h1>    
<div><img src="img/Me.jpg" alt="Photo of me" style="float:right; width:20vw; margin-left: 3%;">
<p>Hello! My name is Jadon Kam and I’m currently a student at Wilfrid Laurier University studying User Experience Design. </p>
<p>If it wasn’t clear already from my portfolio looking like an art museum, I love art and design! At a young age, I developed an interest in drawing, and as I grew older, I became interested in painting, going to art museums, sculpture and 3D art, digital art, interior design, and more! Another hobby I loved starting at a young age was reading mystery books. I loved learning about each character and trying to find the solution to the mystery before the detective revealed the answer. </p>
<p>As a result of my love for design and my interest in solving problems, I decided to study and become a UX designer. Although the problems I work on as a UX designer aren’t as mysterious as the problems my favourite detectives worked on, I love working on UX problems and couldn’t think of another job I would enjoy more! I look forward to working with others on projects where I can learn what users desire in a product and design a better experience for them. If you are interested in hiring or collaborating with me, please fill out my contact form. Thanks!</p>

    <h1>What is my favourite project?</h1>
    <p>My favourite project I’ve done is Travel Kitt! I loved solving the problem of making travel information interesting and engaging for children. As someone who has enjoyed working as a children summer camp counsellor for the past few years, I really enjoyed creating an app for children and having them as the user group we focused on in this project. I also loved what my teammate and I were able to create visually as well as the concept behind the interface to have a scrapbook which families can keep to learn about places and remember their happy experiences on vacation.

    <h1>What am I looking forward to learn more about?</h1>
    <p>I’m looking forward to continue learning about accessible and inclusive design. Whether that’s designing interfaces or creating products, I’m interested and believe it’s my responsibility as a UX designer to make sure users who need accessible features for sight, hearing, movement, etc. are included in my user-centred design process.</p>

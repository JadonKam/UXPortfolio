<h1>About Me</h1>    
<div><img src="img/Me.jpg" alt="Photo of me" style="float:right; width:20vw; margin-left: 3%;">
<p>Hello! My name is Jadon Kam and I’m currently a student at Wilfrid Laurier University studying User Experience Design. </p>
<p>At a young age, I developed an interest in drawing and making crafts at school. As I grew older, I became interested in other <mark>art activities</mark> such as painting, going to art museums, digital art, and interior design. <mark>Problem solving activities</mark> (such as reading and solving mysteries in detective novels as well as logic games and puzzles) were another way I loved to spend my free time starting at a young age.</p>
<p>As a result of <mark>my love for design and my interest in solving problems,</mark> I decided to study and become a UX designer. I love designing and creating user-friendly and memorable experiences and could not think of another job I would enjoy more than working in UX. I look forward to working with others on projects where I can learn what users desire in a product and design a better experience for them. If you are interested in contacting me, please fill out <a href="contact.html">my contact form</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>Here’s a bit more about me:</p>

    <h1>What are my skills?</h1>
    <ul class="about-me">
        <li><b>UX skills</b>: user research, prototyping (Adobe XD and Figma), user testing, design thinking</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the past 4 to 5 years, I have developed my UX skills through working on many UX projects in school, my co-op work term placement with Health Canada, and design competitions.</li>
            <li>Since June 2022, I have been working with Canada's food guide as a Digital Communications Officer, where I improve the user experience of the current food guide website and develop new prototypes for new digital products.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Digital art</b> and <b>graphic design</b> (Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>All of my UX projects highlight the interfaces that I designed. I also designed the art museum-themed interface and characters of my portfolio's website.</li>
            <li>I have 2 years of experience as a graphic designer for my high school yearbook. I also took extracurricular art classes for 4 years to develop my skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>I created this portfolio by using HTML and CSS, not a website builder.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>What is my favourite project?</h1>
    <p>My favourite project I have done is <a href="travel-kitt.html" style="color: darkblue;">Travel Kitt</a>. I loved solving the problem of <b>making travel information interesting and engaging for children</b>. As someone who has enjoyed working as a children summer camp counsellor in the past, I like thinking of activities that children would be interested in doing and enjoyed creating an app for children and their families through this project. I also loved what my teammate and I were able to create visually, specifically the concept to have <b>a digital book</b> which families can keep to <b>learn about places</b> and <b>remember their happy experiences on vacation</b>. You can <a href="travel-kitt.html" style="color: darkblue;">view this project by clicking here!</a></p>

<div class="boxed-full" style="background-color: #faeec7;">
    <h1>What am I looking forward to learn more about?</h1>
    <p>I’m looking forward to continue learning about <b>accessible and inclusive design</b>. Whether that’s designing interfaces or creating products, I’m interested and believe it’s my responsibility as a UX designer to make sure users who need accessible features for sight, hearing, movement, etc. are <b>included in my user-centred design process</b>.</p>

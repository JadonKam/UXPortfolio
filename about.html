<h1>About Me</h1>
<br/>    
<div><img src="img/AboutMeIllustration.png" alt="" style="float:right; width:17vw; margin-left: 3%;">
<p>Hello! My name is Jadon Kam, and I recently graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University with a <b>Bachelor's Degree in User Experience Design</b>. </p>
<p>For two years during my studies, I worked on various digital and UX projects for <b>Health Canada</b>, specifically working as a <b>Junior Digital Communications Officer for Canada's Food Guide</b>. I started as a co-op student but after my co-op term ended, I continued to work there part-time while I finished school.</p>
<p>I decided to become a UX designer due to <b>my love for design and my interest in solving problems</b>. At a young age, I developed an interest in drawing and making crafts at school. As I grew older, I became interested in other art activities such as painting, going to art museums, and digital art. Realizing that I could apply this passion for design into my career, I chose to complete a 5 year program at Wilfrid Laurier University to prepare myself with the skills I needed to be a strong UX designer.</p>
<p>While I enjoy the visual design part of UX design, what really makes UX design special to me is how <b>problem solving in UX is connected to having empathy with the users of a product</b>. The ability to create or improve a product so that it has a positive or memorable impact on someone's life is one of the many reasons why I could not think of another job I would enjoy more than working in UX.</p>
<p>If you are interested in contacting me, please fill out <a href="contact.html"><b>my contact form</b></a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>Here’s a bit more about me:</p>
<div class="boxed-full" style="background-color: #d5eee8;">
    <h1>What are my skills?</h1>
    <ul class="about-me">
        <li><b>UX skills</b>: user research, prototyping (Figma), usability testing, design thinking</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In the past 5 years, I have developed my UX skills through working on many UX projects in school, my co-op work term placement with Health Canada, and design competitions.</li>
            <li>From June 2022 to May 2024, I worked for Canada's food guide as a Digital Communications Officer, where I improved the user experience of the current food guide website and developed new prototypes for new digital products.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Digital art</b> and <b>graphic design</b> (Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>All of my UX projects highlight the interfaces that I designed. I also designed the art museum-themed interface and characters of my portfolio's website.</li>
            <li>I have 2 years of experience as a graphic designer for my high school yearbook. I also took extracurricular art classes for 4 years to develop my skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>I created this portfolio by using HTML and CSS, not a website builder.</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>What is my favourite project?</h1>
    <p>It is difficult for me to choose one project, so I will choose <b>one in terms of the design process</b> and <b>one in terms of the final prototype design</b>.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Focusing on the design process, my favourite project would be working with Rocket Homes to <a href="rockethomes.html" style="color: darkblue; text-decoration: underline;">design a real estate website to help the blind and visually impaired learn about homes on the market</a>. Through this project I was able to <b>talk with and interview users with different types of visual impairments, learn how they use screen readers and other assistive technologies, and design a website that was focused on their needs and preferences</b>. It was my first time working on <b>a project that emphasized accessibility as its main priority</b>, and as a result, it is also the project where I have learned the most. While the visual design of the final product was quite basic, as that was not the priority of the project, being able to hear the positive feedback from people with visual impairments when they used our prototype and being able to learn from them throughout the design process made this one of my favourite projects.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>In terms of the final prototype design, my favourite project would be <a href="travel-kitt.html" style="color: darkblue; text-decoration: underline;">Travel Kitt</a>. I loved creating fun activities and visuals for children to solve the problem of <b>making travel information interesting and engaging for children</b>. As someone who has enjoyed working as a summer camp counsellor in the past, thinking of activities that children would be interested in doing and designing them as part of the app was an enjoyable challenge. I also loved what my teammate and I were able to create visually, specifically the concept to have <b>a digital book</b> which families can keep to <b>learn about places</b> and <b>remember their happy experiences on vacation</b>.

<div class="boxed-full" style="background-color: #faeec7;">
    <h1>What am I looking forward to learn more about?</h1>
    <p>I’m looking forward to continue learning about <b>accessibility and inclusive design</b>. Whether that’s designing interfaces or user research, I’m interested and believe it’s my responsibility as a UX designer to make sure users who need accessible features for sight, hearing, movement, etc. are <b>included in my user-centred design process</b>.</p>

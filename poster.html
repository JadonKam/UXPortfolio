    <h1>Everything Everywhere All At Once Poster</h1>
    <p>One of my hobbies is digital painting by opening a blank canvas in Photoshop and using the brush tool to paint. This is a <mark>digital painting that I created of the movie Everything Everywhere All At Once.</mark> I wanted to have a circle in the middle of the poster where <mark>the top half of the circle matched the colours of the googly eye</mark> in the movie and <mark>the bottom half of the circle matched the colours of the bagel</mark> in the movie. The googly eye and bagel are important metaphors in the film that represent the film's main themes, so I wanted them to be featured at the center of my painting but in a unique way. I used Evelyn's piano, Alpha Waymond's circular portals, Evelyn's googly eye, the rock's googly eye, and Evelyn's washing machine to form the top half of the circle representing the googly eye. I used Jobu's eye makeup, Raccacoonie's tail, Jobu's bagel, Deirdre's circle on the taxes paper, and Waymond's fanny pack to form the bottom half of the circle representing the bagel.</p>

    <h1>Toronto Public Library “First and Best 2024” Poster</h1>
    <p>For a job application as a graphic designer at Toronto Public Library, I wanted to make the library a poster about their <a href="https://kids.tpl.ca/ready-for-reading/books/booklist" target="_blank">First and Best 2024 list</a>, which has Toronto Public Library's top 10 books of 2024 for children under 5. I <mark>designed a poster with a flow chart</mark> to help parents and children pick one of the top ten books to read first. I <mark>used Photoshop to digitally paint a forest with paths that parents and children can follow</mark> to find a book that interests them. I also included illustrations from the top 10 books throughout the forest.</p>

    <h1>Laurier UX Design Program Poster</h1>
    <p>For a graphic design project, I was tasked with creating a poster to <mark>promote Wilfrid Laurier University’s User Experience Design program</mark> which is where I completed my bachelor's degree. The requirements for this poster were that it must include the university and program’s name, Laurier’s logo, Laurier’s colours (purple, gold, and red), a statement about the program, the link to Laurier's website, and all images and artwork besides the logo had to be original work created by me.</p>
    <p>I started by thinking about what I wanted my statement to be. After coming up with my statement, I created <mark>images to tell a story</mark> related to my statement and <mark>images related to courses that the UX design program offered.</mark> I wanted to <mark>highlight the user-centered approach we use</mark> in the program and the different areas of design that we cover in my poster through the text and visuals. I used Adobe Illustrator to create this poster.</p>
